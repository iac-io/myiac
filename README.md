# MyIAC

![Build](https://github.com/iac-io/myiac/workflows/Build%20MyIaC/badge.svg?branch=master) 
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/iac-io/myiac/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=RSFM9B2QJ5)](https://codecov.io/gh/iac-io/myiac)

Infrastructure as code. GCP for now.

## Setup

* Create a GCP service account with admin privileges from here: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#iam-service-accounts-create-console
* Download the json file and store in your user directory (`$HOME/account.json`)
* Install Go [here](https://golang.org/dl/), it should be Go `v1.13` at least
* Clone the project
* If deployments are going to be run, export the environment variable `CHARTS_PATH` pointing to a folder that contains Helm Charts. This folder should follow the structure `charts/{appName}`. Inside, the typical structure for a Helm chart should be present (templates, values.yaml...)
```
export CHARTS_PATH=/path/to/charts
```

## Build executable

```
$ go build cmd/myiac/myiac.go
$ ./myiac

# Move it to PATH folder to run command from anywhere
# $ mv ./myiac /usr/local/bin
```

## Get usage help

```
myiac help
myiac [subcommand] help
```

## Known issues & work in progress

Currently only the following subcommands are working as expected in the `master` branch (the project is undergoing a massive cleanup & refactor):

- `setupEnvironment`
- `deploy`
- `crypt`
- `createSecret`
- `dockerBuild`
- `createCert` (basic usage)

The cluster needs to be created beforehand as the `createCluster` and `destroyCluster` subcommands are currently not working.
